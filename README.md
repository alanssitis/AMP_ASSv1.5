to learn more about this repo and code standards.

## Developing

The best way to work with the codebase is within a Ubuntu 20.04 VM. To do so,
clone this repo, install all the dependencies and build the project.

```bash
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -iry
catkin_make
```

For people unable to work in a Ubuntu 20.04 VM, it is recommended to work on
the code base within a virtual ROS environment in a docker container. To do so,
the `amp-cli` will help you set up all you'll need.

- To build the amp-cli tool, run:

```
sudo pip install .
```

- Run `amp-cli` to view the available options.
  Run the `devel` option in order to have a good consistent environment.

## Formatting

In order to run the `pre-commit` formatter, install `pre-commit` (via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/)) and `clang` (via your distro's package manager) on your Linux Machine and run:

```
pre-commit install
```

This will make it so that a format check is executed whenever you attempt to commit changes.

In order to pass the formatting check, run the following before every commit:

```
pre-commit run -a
```

The formatter was borrowed from [MoveIt's ROS Repo](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2).
